Project experiences （Selected）
======
* **02/2022-04/2022: Anomaly Detection: BGP data based**
   * Collect real attack events (Nimda/Slammer/CodeRed) time sequential update message data from RIPE.
   * Data preprocess and select 7 features (Based on attack relevance) as the model input. 
   * By testing, LSTM can gain 93.7% accuracy with both 3k of normal and anomaly sequential data.
* **10/2020-now: DNS domain verify system**
   * Develope a 100k/minute/server-level domain query modual by asynchronous multiprocess method.
   * Assigned maintenance related works.
   * Gain Develop/Performance optimization/Batch deployment/maintenance experience on Linux Server.
* **02/2019-01/2020: Nonparametric QCD for High-dimensional Sequential Data  （M.S thesis）**
   * Propose Generative Model (GAN & VAE) based nonparametric QCD algorithms to deal with high-dimensional sequential data QCD problem. 
   * Best QCD peformance on 10D Gaussian/KDD/SWAT datasets compared with some popular QCD alogrithms. 
* **03/2018-05/2018: BPNN based Transformer Fault Detection （B.S thesis）**
   * Establish BPNN a transformer fault detection model with IEC three ratio processed transformer gas data.
   * Optimize BPNN model with GA & PSO algorithms and gain the optimal detection accuracy: 95%± 2%
