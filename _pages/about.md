I am a Research Engineer at CETC Cyber Security Research Instituion from Jun 2020 to Now. I completed my M.S degree in the Department of Electrical Engineering at [University at Buffalo, The State University of New York](https://www.buffalo.edu) in Jan,2020, supervised by [Prof. Shaofeng Zou](https://sites.google.com/view/szou/home). I received the B. S. degree (with honors) from [Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications](http://www.cqupt.edu.cn) in 2018.

[GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads!
