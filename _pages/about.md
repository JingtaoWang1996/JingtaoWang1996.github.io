I am a Research Engineer at CETC Cyber Security Research Instituion from Jun 2020 to Now. I completed my M.S degree in the Department of Electrical Engineering at [University at Buffalo, The State University of New York](https://www.buffalo.edu) in Jan,2020, supervised by [Prof. Shaofeng Zou](https://sites.google.com/view/szou/home). I received the B. S. degree (with honors) from [Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications](http://www.cqupt.edu.cn) in 2018.

[GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io). -->
