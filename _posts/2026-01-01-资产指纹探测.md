## Website Fingerprint on LEO Satellite Internet 

* **全文核心问题**：whether **LEO satellite Internet users are <u>more vulnerable</u> to website fingerprinting attacks** than users using traditional fiber connections. 【使用leo的网络用户是否比光纤用户更容易受到fingerprint attack】

* 解决方式：To answer this question, we s**et up an experimental testbed using both a**
  **fiber and Starlink connection**, and use it to collect a dataset of website accesses over
  Tor. 
  * Leverage state-of-the-art website fingerprinting attacks over our collected traces
    to understand whether network adversaries able to inspect the ground links of both kinds
    of connections are able to identify which websites are being accessed by users. 
* **结论**：通过 Starlink 互联网链路传输的 Tor 流量与通过传统光纤链路传输的 Tor 流量一样，都容易受到网站指纹识别攻击。【Our finding suggest that Tor traffic exchanged over Starlink Internet links is equally
  vulnerable to website fingerprinting attacks as Tor traffic exchanged over traditional fiber
  links. 】
  * 可能的假设：尽管连接我们测量节点到 Tor 网络的地面卫星链路或传统光纤链路具有不同的连接特性，但大多数观测到的变化都会被 Tor 自身电路引起的网络效应（例如，增加的延迟、抖动）所吸收和最小化。

### Intro

* TLS do noting about hidding communication metadata(五元组、信息交换的时间节点)
  * Tor网络 makes use of a technique known as onion routing to obscure the destination IP address of a user‘s communication by routing their user's traffic through multiple internet nodes that comprise a Tor circuit.
* Tor网络可以一定程度上提供保护，但是还是有方式绕过Tor网络的保护策略
  * An attacker can build a database of website fingerprint（a set of signatures drawn from different characteristics of the traffic observed when accessing a given website over Tor), and then attempt to **match the traffic pattern generated by a Tor user** to the fingerprint comprising this database.
* The traffic characteristics used to build each website fingerprint consit of **timing and direction characteristics of traffic**,while the matching step usually depends on the application of ML based classifier that is trained using the fingerprint contained in the adversary's database. 
* LEO网络涉及连接的问题：
  * the latency and throughput of satellite connections are highly dynamic and users frequently experience service interruptions as a result of high packet loss.
  * Many environmental factors, including temperature, precipitation, cloud cover, solar storms, and terrain, have a significant impact on the performance and power consumption of satellite connections

### Contribution

* **A new dataset of Tor traffic over LEO satellite（starlink）**
* A new dataset over a fiber link to enable the direct comparison of results throughout 
* An experimental study over the success of state-of-the-art website fingerprinting attacks
  over satellite links.
* An exploration over the suitability of existing website fingerprinting defences to be
  deployed on LEO satellite-based Internet links.
